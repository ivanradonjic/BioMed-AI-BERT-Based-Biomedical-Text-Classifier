Project Overview
Welcome to the BERT-Based Biomedical Text Classification Project! This project aims to classify biomedical research documents related to cancer into three distinct categories: Thyroid Cancer, Colon Cancer, and Lung Cancer. By leveraging BERT and TensorFlow, the goal is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately categorize lengthy research papers based on their content.
Project Status
Please note that this project is currently a work in progress. I will be continuously updating and uploading new developments as I make progress. Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as I work towards improving the accuracy and performance of the classification model.

Goals and Objectives
Develop a Classification Model: Utilize BERT and TensorFlow to create a machine learning model capable of classifying biomedical text documents into the specified cancer categories.
Improve Model Accuracy: Continuously refine and enhance the model to achieve higher accuracy and reliability in classification.
Share Progress: Keep the community informed with regular updates and insights into the project's development.
